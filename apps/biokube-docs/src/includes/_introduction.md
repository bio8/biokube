# Introduction

Welcome to <b>Biokube</b>. <br>

<b>Biokube</b> is a Full stack open source Rapid Application Design & Prototype & Development Factory for scalable cloud agnostic application Deployments in Production. <br>
This project brings together best of breed and production ready open source tools and technologies into an opiniated sweet spot ecosystem that enables rapid deployments of any web application platform. <br>
To achieve this goal, <b>Biokube</b> embodies a two dimensional approach for application design, development and delivery: <br> 
In its Vertical dimension <b>Biokube</b> provides all the components and apis needed for each stack layer of the vertical slices that builds up a full stack production ready application. <br>
From a Horizontal dimension, <b>Biokube</b> supports a complete lifecycle workflow from the initial design & prototype stage up to the production deployment phase and beyond (maintenance & decommissioning).

<b>Motivation.</b> Today designing, developing, deploying and maintaining the complete lifecycle of web applications and platforms still require an enormous amount of planning, building and configuring boilerplate code for common services and features, <br>
that every modern web application needs over all vertical stack layers and horizontal lifecycle stages of scalable production ready application deployments.<br>
Many efforts and initiatives to standardize best practises and eliminating repetitive tasks into smart code have already been undertaken by the open source community in different areas of the vertical layers or horizontal lifecycle stages of modern web applications and web platforms.<br>
Great examples of such initiatives are [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) by Vercel, an opiniated Frontend React framework, or the wonderful [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) project, an opiniated Backend NodeJS framework, [Nx](https://nx.dev/react) by Nrwl, an opiniated Monorepo Toolkit, and [K3S](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/), also an opiniated kubernetes distribution created by Rancher (now acquired by one of the biggest open source consortia [SuSE Linux](https://www.suse.com/). All these projects have one thing in common:  

- Express strong opinions without sacrificing best practises 
- Produce sensible defaults without sacrificing controlability
- Reduce complexity without sacrificing flexibility
- Improve DX (Developer eXperience)

<b>Biokube</b> builds upon these efforts and focuses on bringing all vertical stack layers and horizontal lifecycle stages together into one extensible full stack web application Factory platform.
Using <b>Biokube</b> must alleviate the pain of writing and configuring tedious and repetitive application features that are foundational components and features of any full stack web application platform. <br>
<b>Biokube</b> sets the stage for designers to directly start designing and prototyping the end-user application and for developers to directly start implementing the crucial business domain features as Pluggable services on top of <b>Biokube</b> application Factory platform.
